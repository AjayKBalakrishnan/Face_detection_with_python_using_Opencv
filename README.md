## Introduction

Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.his technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.



Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Today we will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.

## Objective 
This is the repository linked to the tutorial with the same name. The idea is to introduce people to the concept of object detection in Python using the OpenCV library and how it can be utilized to perform tasks like Facial detection.

## Installation
OpenCV-Python supports all the leading platforms like Mac OS, Linux, and Windows. It can be installed in either of the following ways:
